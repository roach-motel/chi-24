## Summary


Subscribing to online services is typically a straightforward process, but cancelling them can be arduous and confusing — causing
many to resign and continue paying for services they no longer use.

Making the cancellation process intentionally difficult is recognized as a dark pattern called _Roach Motel_ (or [_Hard to Cancel_](https://www.deceptive.design/types/hard-to-cancel)). This paper characterizes the
subscription and cancellation flows of popular news websites from four different countries, and discusses them in the context of recent
regulatory changes.
